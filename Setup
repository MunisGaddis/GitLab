🚀 1. Pull the GitLab CE Docker Image
Copy this command and run it in your terminal:
docker pull gitlab/gitlab-ce

🛠️ 2. Verify the Image Was Downloaded
After the pull completes successfully, check that the image exists:
docker image ls | grep gitlab-ce

🏃‍♂️ 3. Run GitLab Container (without volumes, just to test)
Launch the container:
docker run -d -p 8000:80 gitlab/gitlab-ce

✅ Note:
This will map GitLab’s internal HTTP port (80) to your local port 8000.

🌐 4. Wait for GitLab to Initialize
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8000

You may see a 502 Bad Gateway error for a few minutes.
This is normal—GitLab is bootstrapping services inside the container.
Just wait 3–5 minutes.

🔍 5. Get Running Container Details
Check that your container is running:

docker ps | grep gitlab-ce

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                   NAMES
6befb2ecb255   gitlab/gitlab-ce    "/assets/wrapper"   1 minute ago     Up 1 minute     0.0.0.0:8000->80/tcp     hungry_banach

Copy the CONTAINER ID (6befb2ecb255 in this example).

🔑 6. Get the Initial Root Password
docker exec -it <container_id> cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
docker exec -it 6befb2ecb255 cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
This will output something like:
Password: AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt

✨ 7. Log in to GitLab
Go back to http://localhost:8000

Username: root
Password: (the password you just copied)

💾 8. IMPORTANT: Use Docker Volumes to Persist Data
If you want your data NOT to be lost when the container is removed, you must mount volumes.

🛑 Stop and Remove the Old Container
List containers:
docker ps

Stop the container:
docker stop <container_id>

Remove it:
docker rm <container_id>

✅ Run GitLab Again With Volumes

This command will:
Map ./gitlab/config to /etc/gitlab (config files)
Map ./gitlab/data to /var/opt/gitlab (repositories and data)

docker run -d \
  -p 8000:80 \
  -v ./gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab \
  -v ./gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab \
  gitlab/gitlab-ce
💡 Tip:
Make sure the ./gitlab directories exist and are writable by Docker.
If you want them in a different location (e.g., /srv/gitlab), just adjust the paths.

✅ Done!

After about 5 minutes, you should be able to:
Access GitLab at: http://localhost:8000

Log in with:
Username: root
Password: (same initial password or the one you set after first login)
