First copy the docker pull command from the docker hub

docker pull gitlab/gitlab-ce

Once the docker pull command runs successfully, you should have the GitLab docker image on your local machine by inspecting using this command.

docker image ls | grep gitlab-ce

Run GitLab Container from Docker Image

docker run -d -p 8000:80 gitlab/gitlab-ce

Try to visit http://localhost:8000 after around 5 minutes, you could see a 502 response . This means that the container is running. 
Everything is fine with the container but the GitLab server inside that container is not ready yet to accept requests.

First get the details of the running container using the following command.
docker ps | grep gitlab-ce

Default user name is root

In order to get pasword paste below command
docker exec -it 6befb2ecb255 cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password

Copy the password 
acces localhost:8000
Enter User name and Password

If you want to be safe in case of any disaster or for any reason the container may be deleted, you need to start your GitLab container 
by attaching a docker volume where the docker volume will permanently save the data from the GitLab container.

Stop your running container, delete it and retry using the following command.

docker run -p 8000:80 \
           -v ./gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab \
           -v ./gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab \
      gitlab/gitlab-ce
